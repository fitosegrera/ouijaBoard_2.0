ouijaBoard_2.0
==============

This Version of the ouija board uses a raspberry pi, python with wiringPi and google's speech API to operate. The reason why I developed this version is because the accuracy of google's API is superior than the one I achieved with pocketsphinx in the earlier version.

###Software Installation:

For instructions on how to set-up your raspberry pi from scratch follow my previous repository https://github.com/fitosegrera/ouijaBoard_1.0/edit/master/README.md

###Putting everything together

These python 2.7 libraries are needed:

sys
os
urllib2
json
subprocess
